# MITRE ATT&CK Framework â€“ Equifax Breach Mapping

This lab maps the 2017 Equifax breach to MITRE ATT&CK techniques and tactics.

## Summary
- Explores the use of specific MITRE techniques such as T1595.002 (Recon), T1190 (Initial Access), and others.
- Describes the timeline and mechanics of the attack.
- Provides a breakdown of how the breach occurred, how attackers moved laterally, and what they exploited.
- Includes actionable recommendations for detection and prevention.

## Overview
This section maps a [real-world breach](./Lab2.md) (Equifax) to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, providing insights into how 
attackers progress through tactics like Reconnaissance, Initial Access, and Privilege Escalation. 
Each step is tied to MITRE Tactic IDs, helping readers understand and apply the framework for threat modelling and incident analysis.

This case study highlights the importance of patch management, access control, and SOC visibility.
